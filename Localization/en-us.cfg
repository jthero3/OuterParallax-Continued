		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_crewReport_SlateSrfLandedGorgorothPlateau = You wonder what this place used to look like when Slate was a living world. Now it's a skeleton- the bones of which reach up into the sky, surrounding your craft.
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_crewReport_SlateSrfLandedMuilHills = The petrified trees are certainly something. They almost look like frozen centipedes, caught trying to skitter off into space and escape their dead world.
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_crewReport_SlateSrfLandedOrodruinChaos = Black trees stand up from the rubble like hands reaching out of a grave- but they, too, are as dead as the earth below.
	
		//Many Tekto defs are named after the original OPM defs they replace instead of their biome.
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_crewReport_TektoSrfLandedDesolatePlace = An alien landscape stretches before you. We thought Tekto would be barren and lifeless; instead we've found an alien jungle unlike anything previously encountered. Unusual creatures soar lazily through the sky, and sleek shapes dart through the underbrush. It's like you've entered another dimension. Is it safe to go outside?
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_crewReport_TektoSrfLandedDeckchair = The craft groans as a massive creature lumbers past, its spindly legs striding slowly and nudging the hull to the side. This thing is designed to handle a vacuum, but it's not rated for alien attacks!
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_crewReport_TektoSrfLandedStable = This ecosystem is beyond our wildest expectations. We would never have expected such a diverse array of life, especially not on such a cold world, where water is invariably solid. Could these organisms use hydrocarbons as a solvent instead?
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_crewReport_TektoSrfLandedIslands = The life on Tekto's islands is distinct from that of the mainland- it seems most organisms are smaller overall, but exist in more dense concentrations.
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_crewReport_TektoSrfLandedPolarRifts = The barren, jagged landscape nevertheless plays host to an assortment of life. The so-called sky feathers from other regions are enormous here, and sway gently in the winds. They lend Tekto's jagged polar rifts an even more alien atmosphere.
		
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_crewReport_TektoFlyingLowFlattest = It's like something out of a dream.
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_crewReport_TektoFlyingLowMuddy = Is that a village...? No, couldn't be.
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_crewReport_TektoFlyingLowBlackSpots = Is it safe to land? Do you think there are sapient natives? Maybe we should be careful not to land on any aliens.
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_crewReport_TektoFlyingLowTan = Maybe you can land on one of those caps? Probably a bad idea...
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_crewReport_TektoFlyingLowPolarRifts = You accidentally fly into one of those towering strands, and breathe a sigh of relief as it harmlessly slides off your craft.
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_crewReport_TektoFlyingHigh = Are those... trees?
		
	
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_evaReport_SlateSrfLandedGorgorothPlateau = The trees surrounding you creep you out more than a little bit. Slate really is a dead world. At least there'll be plenty of fossils to study.
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_evaReport_SlateSrfLandedDagorladRegion = Did that tree just move?
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_evaReport_SlateSrfLandedOrodruinChaos = What... What HAPPENED here...?
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_evaReport_SlateSrfLandedKowganArchipelago = If this used to be a tropical paradise, you can't tell... Come to think of it, it probably would've been way too cold.
		
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_evaReport_TektoSrfLandedBoysHome = Nobody would believe you if you hadn't gotten like, a million pictures. This- THIS!!! This is why we have a space program! It was absolutely worth the trip out here.
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_evaReport_TektoSrfLandedStickyMuck = Tekto's alien wilderness chirps and warbles. You can hear a cacophony of activity as animals chatter with each other, both familiar and strange. It's mesmerizing.
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_evaReport_TektoSrfLandedUphere = You spy a group of unusual orange creatures moving through the thick foliage with purpose, each a little taller and thinner than a Kerbal. They're... wearing masks and carrying tools?! Oh, wow! Looks like we might need to designate Tekto as a protected world.
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_evaReport_TektoSrfLandedIslands = This place is a miracle. You suppose all the naysaying about hydrocarbons being unlikely as a solvent was silly in hindsight. Tekto's untamed wilderness is utterly alien and jaw-droppingly beautiful.
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_evaReport_TektoSrfLandedPolarRifts = This place is quite captivating. The spiky terrain is incredibly bizarre, looking more like an ancient alien geoengineering project than a natural formation. Though there are no trees, enormous sky feathers blow in the wind; reaching far higher than any of Tekto's trees ever do.
		

		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_mysteryGoo_SlateSrfLandedMuilHills = The Goo wants to go home.
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_mysteryGoo_SlateSrfLandedDagorladRegion = The Goo seems to be afraid of the petrified trees.
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_mysteryGoo_SlateSrfLandedOrodruinChaos = The Goo flinches several times, apparently staring at a nearby dead tree.
		
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_mysteryGoo_TektoSrfLandedSandy = The frigid winds are apparently just right for the Goo.
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_mysteryGoo_TektoSrfLandedStraight = The Goo notices a nearby creature at about the same time as you do. Said creature, carrying a spear and wearing some sort of mask, approaches the craft and curiously pokes the Goo with its weapon, causing the Goo to panic. The creature quickly retreats.
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_mysteryGoo_TektoSrfLandedSad = The Goo seems to feel content here.
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_mysteryGoo_TektoSrfLandedSomething = The Goo appears to be sampling organic molecules from the air.
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_mysteryGoo_TektoSrfLandedInspiration = The Goo has produced several feathered strands and is mimicking the local sessile organisms.
		
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_surfaceSample_SlateSrfLandedTreeSamples = You take a sample of one of the petrified trees, despite your instincts telling it you's going to grab you. It's definitely something kind of like petrified wood, but the interior structure is way different. It would seem this organism incorporated rock into its biology long before it died.
		
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_surfaceSample_TektoSrfLandedMushwoods = You cut out a sample from one of the giant trees. The lab guys are tentatively referring to them as mushwoods. It seems that, like other 'plants' on Tekto, they're only green by coincidence. They use their ridged caps and long, hanging fronds to gather organic molecules in the atmosphere to use for energy. The caps are soft but hold their shape, sort of like cartilage.
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_surfaceSample_TektoSrfLandedSkyFeathers = You take a shaving off of one of the tall, slender strands. You've taken to calling these sky feathers. They reach so high because of their wing-shaped ends, which catch the wind and gather organic molecules from the air to feed on.
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_surfaceSample_TektoSrfLandedWindLilies = You sample one of the tentacles of the orange-colored flower-like organisms. They're calling these wind lilies. Rather like sea lilies back on Kerbin, they capture airborne organic matter and gently bring it to the central tendril, which absorbs it for digestion.
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_surfaceSample_TektoSrfLandedGrass = You cut out a few blades of 'grass'. Although it is green, like everything else on Tekto this is only coincidence. These organisms capture organic matter from the wind, and use that for fuel. Plants on Tekto depend very much on the wind, rather than the sun.
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_surfaceSample_TektoSrfLandedIslands = Sampling the 'plant' life here- or the 'Tektozoa' as the lab boys insist you call it- shows a clear difference from life on the mainland. It would appear these ecosystems have remained disconnected from the mainland for millions of years.
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_surfaceSample_TektoSrfLandedPolarRifts = The polar life does not seem to have been affected by the dim light at the poles. What affects it more is the air currents here, which are a fair bit gentler than those in lower latitudes. The sky feathers have had to grow extremely tall to catch enough food on the wind.
		
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_SlateSrfLandedGorgorothPlateau = The materials seem to be disturbed by the desolation around them.
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_SlateSrfLandedDagorladRegion = The materials do not approve of the way that tree is 'looking' at them.
		#LOC_OPLX_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_SlateSrfLandedOrodruinChaos = The materials are cowering.
		
		// DMagic Orbital Science
		#LOC_OPLX_DMagSciDef_scopeScan_SlateInSpaceLow = Slate is a dead world, with a desolate landscape and boulders covering the surface. What appear to be countless large 'rock spires' cover the continents, but they don't look like natural formations. Curious...
		
		#LOC_OPLX_DMagSciDef_scopeScan_TektoInSpaceLow = It is difficult to see Tekto's surface through the dense clouds, but you see large circular shapes covering the surface almost everywhere. What could those be?
		
		#LOC_OPLX_DMagSciDef_dmReconScan_SlateInSpaceLowSouthernHemisphere = High-resolution imaging of Slate's continents reveals something startling: The mysterious rock formations spotted earlier are not rocks at all; they appear to be petrified trees!
		
		#LOC_OPLX_DMagSciDef_dmReconScan_TektoInSpaceLowNorthernHemisphere = Photos of Tekto's surface are hard to get because of its thick atmosphere, but early analysis shows the presence of many large circular formations on the surface. These are most likely some kind of strange rock formation, though what process could create such shapes is currently unknown.
		
		#LOC_OPLX_DMagSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_SlateSrfLandedContinentsAll = Soil analysis confirms the presence of fossilized plant matter here; though a simple look around you could've told you that.
		#LOC_OPLX_DMagSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_SlateSrfLandedSeabedsAll = Scans of the surface here reveal quartz compounds, salt deposits and fine-grained sand; the sorts of materials one would expect to find in a seabed. There are also signs of past biological activity here, in the form of organic compounds and what appear to be tiny burrows.
		
		#LOC_OPLX_DMagSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_TektoSrfLanded = Tekto's surface is inundated with complex biological compounds and ethane; which is probably the primary solvent for the native life on this moon.
		
		#LOC_OPLX_DMagSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_SlateSrfLandedContinentsAll = Analysis of the surface here reveals complex organic molecules still embedded in the terrain- coupled with the strange rock formations, it is difficult to deny that Slate once had life.
		#LOC_OPLX_DMagSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_SlateSrfLandedSeabedsAll = The laser vaporizes the sandy soil, revealing salt deposits and organic molecules, as well as traces of ammonia ice. Slate's former oceans may not have been made of water.
		
		#LOC_OPLX_DMagSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_TektoSrfLanded = The laser vaporizes a sample of 'plant' life, the spectra indicating a composition of primarily organic compounds. These are vaguely remniscient of Kerbin life, but in place of water there appears to be an abundance of ethane.
		
		#LOC_OPLX_DMagSciDef_dmbathymetryscan_TektoSrfSplashedShallow = Tekto's ethane lakes are full of life. Despite the relatively dense liquid, large organisms swim through it- albeit rather sedately. With such an abundance of organic molecules, they can grow quite large.
		#LOC_OPLX_DMagSciDef_dmbathymetryscan_TektoSrfSplashedDeep = The deepest parts of Tekto's lakes are teeming with life, as a wide array of organisms take advantage of the abundant organic compounds- and the creatures feeding on them.
		
		#LOC_OPLX_DMagSciDef_dmbiodrillscan_SlateSrfLandedContinentsAll = The sample contains organic compounds commonly associated with biological activity on Kerbin. This would be a grand revelation and a strong hint that Slate may have previously had life, but the petrified trees nearby are much stronger evidence.
		#LOC_OPLX_DMagSciDef_dmbiodrillscan_SlateSrfLandedSeabedsAll = This sample contains complex organic compounds, as well as inorganic ones typically associated with the calcium-carbonate shells of marine organisms.
		
		#LOC_OPLX_DMagSciDef_dmbiodrillscan_TektoSrfLandedGrass = The drill samples a strand of alien 'grass'. While it is green, analysis and common sense suggest this is not because of chlorophyll, but rather a natural pigmentation. These organisms- all 'plants' on Tekto, most likely- gather organic material from the air and use that for energy.
		#LOC_OPLX_DMagSciDef_dmbiodrillscan_TektoSrfLandedNatives = While the sample drill is running, a small group of creatures approaches the craft, wearing odd masks and carrying what appear to be tools and weapons. They give the craft a few cautious pokes, before being scared away by the drill moving. Sentient life... This might complicate matters.
		#LOC_OPLX_DMagSciDef_dmbiodrillscan_TektoSrfLandedTrees = The sample drill encounters what appears to be a sapling of one of the large tree-like organisms, and gently takes a small tissue sample. This organism seems to use its large, ridged cap to gather organic matter from the air, but the primary method of capturing this material is the array of fronds hanging off the edges of each cap.
		#LOC_OPLX_DMagSciDef_dmbiodrillscan_TektoSrfLandedPolarRifts = The soil here is a bit less rich than other places on Tekto, but this probably has more to do with the air currents than the temperature. Still, some life persists regardless. The gigantic species of sky feathers here probably uses its extreme height to capture more nutrition from the wind.
		#LOC_OPLX_DMagSciDef_dmbiodrillscan_TektoSrfLandedIslands = Life on Tekto's islands appears to be much smaller than the mainland, but greater in number. Judging by this soil sample, that may be because it has more trouble rooting itself properly in the ground here, so spreading horizontally is more viable than growing vertically.
		#LOC_OPLX_DMagSciDef_dmbiodrillscan_TektoSrfLandedLakes = Tekto's lakes are wet with liquid ethane, which appears to be the primary solvent that life on this moon uses. Looks like Dr. Karter just lost a bet!
